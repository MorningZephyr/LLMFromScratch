# Building LLM from Scratch

This is a project built from a follow along [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=533s)

Most of the python codes are based on what the video has, BUT all the notes are written by me and based off my intepretation and understanding of neural network and pytorch. If there are errors, I will correct them. It's all part of the learning experience

The idea is that if I build something, I'm able to get a better understanding of the concepts. AI is a rapid developing field, and while many people ultilzed popular AI apis such as OpenAI, it's still important to understand how LLM work. Knowing the fundamentals is the key to becoming a mastery of AI.
